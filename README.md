# CryptoRNGTest
We have developed an enhanced Python-based randomness testing library that adheres to and extends the 15 standard tests from NIST, incorporating two unique tests specified by China's National Cryptography Administration. This library is designed to streamline the randomness evaluation process, allowing users to perform scriptable operations through simple function calls and configurations. For test items that fail, we have specifically added detailed error reporting features to help users quickly identify issues, thereby optimizing their random number generation processes.
